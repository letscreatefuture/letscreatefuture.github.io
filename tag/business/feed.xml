      <content type="html" xml:base="/article/rich-dad-poor-dad-advice-to-become-rich-bfswl">&lt;p&gt;You often say sometime that you don’t want to live this kind bad life where you don’t live for yourself. You want freedom to live life as you want.
Everyone want to become rich ,live luxiourious life, travel around the world but they didn’t know where should they start or what should they do that could make him rich and became independent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here, is the &lt;strong&gt;“Rich dad, Poor Dad”&lt;/strong&gt; advice to become rich and earn more money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“True learning takes power, energy and burning desire and Anger is a big part of that formula”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Rich dad, Poor Dad, He primarily focus on 4 skills that make you to understand how the money works and after that you will become Independent. I’ll keep it super simple to understand what are these:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Accounting&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Investing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Understanding markets&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The law:
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Tax advantage&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Protection from lawsuits.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;accounting&quot;&gt;Accounting:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accounting is the financial literacy  or the ability to read numbers. this is most important skill if you want to become rich. The More you generate money, the more accuracy you required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;investing&quot;&gt;Investing:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the idea of ‘‘money making money”. This involve strategies and formula which multiply you money to make more money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;understanding-markets&quot;&gt;Understanding markets:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the science of supply and demand. In this, You need to know the technical aspects of the market which are emotion driven. Means, Does an investment makes more sense or not based ont he current market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-law-&quot;&gt;The law:-&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law is the awareness of accounting corporate, state and federal regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-tax-advantage&quot;&gt;1. Tax advantage:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this, A corporation can do many things than a person can’t  like pay expenses before pay taxes. Means in Basic terms, A rich man buy an “assest” first and then whatever is left on, they pay taxes on it while a normal person pay taxes first and live on what is left after pay tax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-protection-from-lawsuits&quot;&gt;2. Protection from lawsuits:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its s file folder with some legal document that creates a legal document in it. 
For example: when someone filed against a wealthy individual they are often met with layers  of legal protection and often find that the wealthy person actually owns nothing. they control everything , but own nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If, you really want to be rich the only thing you can do is expand your Knowledge. Knowledge in the field of financial terms. If you understand those terms soon you started  to realize that you grow your financial status. NOt so fast, but yeah! it’s started. and you continued to followed your dream path acheive whatever you want in life.
Remember, Knowledge is power. If you got this then YOu are the powerful one.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <content type="html" xml:base="/article/how-to-start-your-own-business-51qez">&lt;p&gt;Hey Entrepreneurs!!! 
Do you want to start something more creative that makes you different from the rest or you want to start the small  business. Everyone of you  have got their own idea. Your idea is in your mind, diary, and desk too and It’s flooded everywhere but you didn’t understand how did you get started with your own idea.  May be you think!! How did you get the capital for your idea, what are the requirements that fulfill your idea, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uhh f**k this!!!!!!! Don’t think too much that makes you feel horrible. In simple word’s due to your fear you didn’t start work on your own idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, Some of the most important keys to start your own business. I’ll keep it simple. So, let’s start…….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Observation&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Understanding&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apply it&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything is secondary if you didn’t start working on your own idea. So, don’t keep in mind. You’re smarter than you think you are. Just go and start work on your ideas because nobody gives you a damn shit about your ideas.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <content type="html" xml:base="/article/what-should-be-the-right-mindset-of-first-time-entrepreneur-k9q2z">&lt;p&gt;If you are the first time Entrepreneur then having the right mindset is very important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, It sound’s good if you have got an idea on which you want to work or if not then your first step is to think about an idea where you could simply work without being tired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having the right mindset of the first-time Entrepreneur is important because it keeps you motivated for the next task and holds your dream higher than anyone. Being an entrepreneur sounds cool but it takes lots of effort, hard work, and much more. I’ll try to keep it very simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-believe-in-yourself-and-dream-big&quot;&gt;1. Believe in Yourself and Dream Big&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to believe yourself first whatever you are going to do there are so many ups and downs. As long as you believe in yourself every difficulty will end up soon. You will stand up again with more power than before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“One should never settle for less and always be ready to dream and achieve big!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-invest-your-time-wisely&quot;&gt;2. Invest your time wisely&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time is a very precious thing once it’s gone it will always begone. So, invest your time to sharpen your skills, read books, learn something new every day, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-learn-from-your-mistakes&quot;&gt;3. Learn from your mistakes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning from your past mistakes is one of the greatest skills. It keeps you one step ahead than you were yesterday and also keeps you away from doing the same mistakes. So, Don’t fear from your mistakes. Do it fast, learn from it, and stand on the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-be-communicative&quot;&gt;4. Be Communicative&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t be shy or fear to communicate with others. If you are shy or have a fear of not able to communicate with others then you can’t learn some of the great lessons which come only to communicate with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-do-hardwork&quot;&gt;5. Do Hardwork&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never fear from doing hard work. Because it put you many steps ahead who just think and sit on the couch. Eventually, Doing Hardwork you developed the skill smart work. It’s one of my observations without doing any hard work you can’t develop smart work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey Entrepreneurs, hold your dreams higher than anyone. Your dream is yours not the others. Work like a hungry beast. Never settle for less, and one more thing Don’t give a shit to others.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <id>/article/how-to-start-a-business-from-scratch-as24h</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="/article/how-to-start-a-business-from-scratch-as24h">&lt;p&gt;Every great business starts with drive and passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;six-steps-to-start-a-business-from-zero&quot;&gt;Six steps to start a business from zero&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-research-your-market&quot;&gt;1. Research your market&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should know deeply what the competition knows and thinks and feels. Dive in to your market and study it like an expert. Search google for keywords that are related to your industry. When you find the keywords flooded with websites, that means it works. There is money there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-set-tangible-goals&quot;&gt;2. Set tangible goals&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work backwords and figure out what you need to do each day to get to where you dream to be in the future when your business or startup is successful. Feel your success Here and Now. Set a goal that is a atretch for you and look at the steps you need to take everyday to accomplish that goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-launch-a-product-or-service-you-can-sell&quot;&gt;3. Launch a product or service you can sell&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a financial goal that you’ve set out for the next six months, then you have to sell something. Take the time to figure out the biggest challenges your audience is facing and build your relationship with them. Then create something that solves their problem. I know this is easier said than done, but it’s critical. Your leads come from your list, you convert them to customers, follow up and build a relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-start-now-and-improve-as-you-go&quot;&gt;4. Start now and improve as you go&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people waste time thinking about making things perfect before they launch their business. The logo, the website, the copy – everything. This is a waste of time. Sell your product before you make it by offering a pre-order. Focus on getting sales and attracting leads. Successful companies launch all the time and they aren’t perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of Facebook and all the changes and improvements it has made. Start with a small product and always be improving. Launch online you can sell over and over and not have to trade time for dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-create-a-great-website-whose-content-is-shareable&quot;&gt;5. Create a great website whose content is shareable&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s great to reference some the leaders in your space, but when you are developing your own brand, it’s important to create unique content on a single hub. A site that your readers and viewers can reference back to, for more of your incredible content. Maybe you can use wordpress or wix to get templates.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <id>/article/how-to-go-from-0-to-billionaire-ori16</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="/article/how-to-go-from-0-to-billionaire-ori16">&lt;p&gt;Well as far as i have found there are certain steps or you can say jumps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-somehow-go-from-0-to-where-you-have-certain-money&quot;&gt;1. Somehow go from 0 to where you have certain money.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe noone starts from zero, they have almost nothing to began with but the resources they have can be used to generate some wealth. Like if you have a computer, you can write blogs, learn programming, do freelancing, build some websites and apps and sell them. Find people who need what you have and give your service to them in exchange for money. Save all the money possible. Like if you really want to be rich, at this stage get money from where ever you can. Learn from youtube videos about entrepreneurship. Learn and use your knowledge to earn money. Now its you job to figure out what and when to learn and how to use it. That what you have got a brain for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have enough money, so that you can work on your business plans move to step 2. Don’t end the step 1 hare. Work on your business idea and also do the side stuffs that will make you money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-use-the-money-to-build-small-business&quot;&gt;2. Use the money to build small business.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While building your own business for first time you will learn lots of new and useful stuffs, you will make many useful connections with all kinds of people and you will also make money. Save all of it the money, the people and the skills. They will prove to be pillars for your later stages. If you work on your business and it is successful, now you are getting enough money to survive. Now arising from this stage is again in your hands and brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-start-a-big-scalable-business-that-has-potential-to-transform-the-world&quot;&gt;3. Start a big scalable business that has potential to transform the world.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now use all the resources you have got to work on really big scalable businesses like the Amazon, Facebook, Google and lots of others that we keep on listening every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As your business will grow you will move to millionaire status and over time you will be multimillionaire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-work-on-solving-problems-that-are-so-difficult-that-nobody-else-could-even-think-about&quot;&gt;4. Work on solving problems that are so difficult that nobody else could even think about.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now its time to work on really hard and useful stuffs. Like Elon Musk is building Tesla and SpaceX, that kind of hard. Because now you have the money and power to pursue unrealistic &amp;amp; unimaginable goals, so this is the time to go for them. They will easily lift you to billionaire and world leader status if done successfully.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
