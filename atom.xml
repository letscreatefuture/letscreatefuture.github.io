        <title>Building our imagination in real world</title>
        
          <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-idea&quot;&gt;The Idea&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our imagination we can create anything. 
We can build, rebuild, destroy any number of times. 
But is the real world we have always been limited. 
In the real world we lack the freedom to create anything we imagine. 
What if we can actually create the real world from scratch using just our mind? 
Will it be an exciting world? 
The world where anyone can build their dream world! 
Here we will build the tech that will allow us to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;
